### Allowing apps to access and modify your accounts

Upon execution time, you'll be prompted to:

- Login into your Spotify account and allow the app to view and modify your account (this is done automatically: it opens your browser)
- Login into your Google account and allow the app to access and modify your YouTube account. You must:
  1. Open the link that the script will show you
  2. Select an account
  3. Click on "Continue", then "Allow":\
     ![](../images/youtube-steps/5.0.png)\

  4. Check the box and click on "Allow":\
     ![](../images/youtube-steps/5.2.png)
  5. Copy the generated code...\
     ![](../images/youtube-steps/5.3.png)\
     ...and paste it on the terminal

## And now... executing for real (finally ðŸ˜…)

1. Download or clone this repo:
   ```
   git clone https://codeberg.org/Shobon03/spot-on-tube
   ```
2. **_Make sure that you created the [Spotify](#getting-your-credentials-from-the-spotify-developers-dashboard) and [YouTube's](#getting-your-credentials-from-the-google-developers-dashboard) app and placed your credentials on their places._**

#### Script

`From the command line`

3. Make sure that you have all [dependencies](#dependencies) installed.
4. Execute `spot-on-tube.py` on your terminal and follow the steps there.
   ```
   pyhton3 spot-on-tube.py
   ```

#### .exe file

`Windows only`

3. Execute `spot-on-tube.exe` and follow the steps there.

Still in development. Soon, the .exe file will be avaliable.

_Update 06-2024: The .exe file is already on the project's root folder._

## Building an .exe file

The `pyinstaller` library is used to generate the .exe file.

Using `pip`:

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

After installing, build the `.py` file (please note that this can take a while...)

[Replace `<filename>.py` with `spot-on-tube.py` or the name you have written]

```
pyinstaller --onefile <filename>.py --icon="images/logos/logo.ico"
```

On the folder `dist`, you'll have your newly created .exe file. Put it on the root folder of the project. You can also delete the `<filename>.spec` file and both the `dist` and `build` folders.
