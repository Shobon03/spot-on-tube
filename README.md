## About

SpotOnTube is a Python script that creates YouTube playlists based on your Spotify playlists. 

The script can also generate a `.json` file containing all songs from the selected Spotify playlist, if the user wants to see them.

### Read this before doing anything

I'm still testing this app to track some errors and bugs and I'm changing some things on the code constantly, such as messages and stuff. If you want to test it and give some feedback, I would much appreciate it!

## Dependencies

The script was made using Python 3.9.

My plan was to use the raw _Spotify Web API_ and _YouTube Data API_ but I couldn't set them properly. After some research, I came across two Python libraries. They are:  [spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) and [youtube-search](https://github.com/joetats/youtube_search).

They helped me so much. They simplified some things and then I was able to give this project some light.

I want to thank all the people involved in those projects, for they brought these libraries to their existence. **You guys are awesome** ðŸ˜Ž

For the YouTube's authorization, it's needed these dependencies:

- google-api-python-client
- google-auth-oauthlib

And, the .exe file for windows users was created using the [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) library.

### List

- spotipy
- youtube-search
- google-api-python-client
- google-auth-oauthlib
- pyinstaller

### Installing

You'll need `pip` to install them. Make sure that you have it installed on your system.

On _UNIX or GNU/Linux_ systems, simply input on your terminal emulator:
```
$ pip install spotipy youtube-search google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib 
```

On _Windows_, if you want to execute the script via terminal, simply input on `cmd` or your terminal emulator:
```
C:\Users\<your username> pip install spotipy youtube-search google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib
```

## Limitations

### YouTube API

In the _YouTube API Daily Quota_ (you can see the cost for each request [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/determine_quota_cost?hl=en)), we have only **10,000 units**, in which we can do operations with. The cost of each YouTube search is **100 units**, but because the youtube_search library is being used, this isn't a problem.

The script does these operations:

- List a user's playlists: **50 units** (only called once)
- Create a playlist: **1 unit** (only called once and if the playlist doesn't exist)
- Insert videos into the playlist:  **50 units** (called per video that will be inserted). So, the maximum limit of videos it can insert per app is **199** (**198** if the playlist needs to be created). This will be, unfortunately, the limit of songs that the script will be able to do with per app or daily (as the quota resets every day at Pacific Time).

The script will automatically detect if there are videos that didn't get to be inserted, and will insert them if the user selects the same playlist, upon executing the program again (this, of course, if the user created another app, or executed the script again).

### [youtube_search](https://github.com/joetats/youtube_search) library

This library is a crawler, therefore not all results will be the same, depending where you live and which video is being search. Maybe some of them will not be the one you want, but the script does its best to find the match. And maybe a video will not be found, so it won't be added in the final playlist.

## Executing

Before executing, it's crucial to have the Spotify and YouTube's app credentials.

### Allowing apps to access and modify your accounts

Upon execution time, you'll be prompted to:
- Login into your Spotify account and allow the app to view and modify your account (this is done automatically: it opens your browser)
- Login into your Google account and allow the app to access and modify your YouTube account. You must:
  1. Open the link that the script will show you
  2. Select an account
  3. Click on "Continue", then "Allow":\
  ![](./images/youtube-steps/5.0.png)\
  ![](./images/youtube-steps/5.1.png)
  4. Check the box and click on "Allow":\
  ![](./images/youtube-steps/5.2.png)
  5. Copy the generated code...\
  ![](./images/youtube-steps/5.3.png)\
  ...and paste it on the terminal

### Executing (finally ðŸ˜…)

1. Download the `zip` [here](https://github.com/Shobon03/spot-on-tube/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.zip) or clone this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Shobon03/spot-on-tube
    ``` 
2. Make sure that you created the [Spotify](#getting-your-credentials-from-the-spotify-developers-dashboard) and [YouTube's](#getting-your-credentials-from-the-google-developers-dashboard) app and placed your credentials on their places.

#### On UNIX or GNU/Linux systems

3. Make sure that you have all [dependencies](#dependencies) installed.
4. Execute `spotOnTube.py` on your terminal and follow the steps there.
    ```
    $ pyhton3 spotOnTube.py
    ```

#### On Windows

3. Execute `spotOnTube.exe` and follow the steps there.

## Building an .exe file

The `pyinstaller` library is used to generate the .exe file.
Using `pip`, install it:
```
C:\<root of the project> pip install pyinstaller
```

After installing, build the .py file on `cmd` or your terminal emulator (please note that this can take a while):
```
C:\<root of the project> pyinstaller --onefile <filename>.py
```

On the folder `dist`, you'll have your newly created .exe file. Put it on the root folder of the project. You can also delete the `<filename>.spec` file and both the `dist` and `build` folders.

## Privacy

The SpotOnTube script ***doesn't*** collect your personal data.

SpotOnTube only accesses your Spotify data to **see your playlists** and **list their tracks** and to modify your YouTube account, but just to **create a playlist** and **insert videos into it**.
